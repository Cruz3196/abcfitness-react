Full Stack Fitness E-Commerce Platform

This project is a comprehensive full stack fitness e-commerce application that utilizes JWT authentication to manage secure user access. The platform includes distinct roles:
  ⚪ JWT Authentication: Secure user access and role-based permissions.
  ⚪ Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage products, oversee fitness classes, and assign users as trainers.
  ⚪ Trainer Capabilities: Trainers can create, host, and edit their own classes.
  ⚪ User Experience: Users can browse and purchase fitness products, book classes, and interact with trainers.
  
In addition to the web platform, the project will introduce a native iOS fitness tracker app, allowing users to monitor workouts, track progress, and sync data with their class activities and purchases.
